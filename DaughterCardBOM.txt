2x AD8224 instrumentation amp	digikey			AD8224ACPZ-R7CT-ND 
1x 2x8pin M 90deg header	digikey			609-3337-ND
4x .01uF 0805 capacitor		digikey			1276-1007-1-ND 
8x 4700pF 1% NP0 0805 capacitor	digikey			490-8288-1-ND		the 1% tolerance isn't necessary, but you need to match capacitor values as well as possible, and the minor increase in cost is offset by the labor savings matching caps
8x 1M 0.1% 0805 resistor	digikey			P1MDACT-ND 		the 0.1% tolerance isn't necessary, but you need to match resistor values as well as possible, and the minor increase in cost is offset by the labor savings matching resistors
4x 499ohm 0805 resistor		digikey			P499CCT-ND 		These set the gain at 100x. Check the AD8224 datasheet to select the correct resistor for alternate gain settings
4x 49.9ohm 0805 resistor	digikey			P49.9CCT-ND 		inline with output to inhibit ringing
