The files in this repository are my attempt to produce a high-quailty,
buffering amplifier for EMG signals in the laboratory environment. I
am NOT a hardware designer by trade and have not necessarily tested
any of the supplied files for my own purposes, much less yours. I 
make no garauntees that these circuits will be useful or even 
functional.

It is important to also note: I have not designed these
to comply with any FDA standards. Any compliance with said standards
is purely coincidental. These designs are inteded for animal research
and are NOT fit for human recordings. 

If you choose to use these designs, it is incumbent on you to evaluate
the schematics and test them to ensure they are adequate, in both 
performance and safety, for your task.

I make no promise of support, however, you are welcome to shoot me
an email if you want to use these designs. I might be able to answer
some simple questions.
